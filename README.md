# Octodive
This is my first time trying to make a game with Phaser and will (hopefully) result in a somewhat finished product for the game jam. The theme was "loophole" and this really stumped me. I am going to try and make a 4 lane sidescroller solo race game where the player is an octopus that has to go through loops for speed. Instead of loopholes, my game actually involves looping through holes.
# Boilerplate
Since I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm going to use the boilerplate from phaser's game tutorial to get me started
