# Octodive
This is my first time trying to make a game with Phaser and will (hopefully) result in a somewhat finished product for HackClub Arcade's game jam. The theme was "loophole" and this really stumped me. I am going to try and make a 4 lane sidescroller solo race game where the player is an octopus that has to go through loops for speed. Instead of loopholes, my game actually involves looping through holes.
If I finish early and have the time and confidence, I might even add an actual loop hole with a boss.

Note: School has already started for me so I will not have enough time to code a whole boss fight sadly but I'm pretty proud of what I have  accomplished.
# Boilerplate
Since I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm going to use the boilerplate from phaser's game tutorial to get me started

# Phaser google font tutorial
I followed a tutorial to import google fonts into the game.

# Art
All art assets were self made by me using piskel (really awesome for drawing and animating pixel art)

# AI Useage
Throughout this project, I used Codeium to help me set up scenes (like the game and gameover screen) and search for phaser functions and things inside the API documentation. If correct and applicable, it also helped autocomplete what I'm about to type.
